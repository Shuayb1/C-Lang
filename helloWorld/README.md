## Running C code

The code is being run using a linux environemnt which has the commands to be used in-build.

1. You can run the hello.c code using `gcc hello.c` and this will output the source file and an executable file i.e `a.out` file (which is an executable file) and the `hello.c` file. To run the executable file; `./a.out`.

2. Or by indicating the output execucatble file i.e `gcc hello.c -o hello`. You will get the executable file `hello` and `hello.c` file. To run the executable; `./hello`.

3. `make` can also be use by running `make hello` (or name of the C code file). You can run the executable file as `/hello`.
